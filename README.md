# Wheels of Jeopardy
---

## Programming Guidelines
- Refer to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for any and all questions.
- [Package and Module names](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#prescriptive-naming-conventions) should be lower case and either alloneword or separated_by_underscores
  - Underscores are discouraged here
- [Class names](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#class-names) should be CapWordConvention
- [Function, Method, and Variable names](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-names) should be lowercase separated_by_underscores when necessary
- [Private/Internal Member names](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#descriptive-naming-styles) should begin with an _underscore
- [Constant names](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#constants) are all CAPITALIZED
- [Indentations](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#indentation) = 4 [spaces](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#tabs-or-spaces)
- [Docstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#rationale) should start each module/class and functions. This will help with pyDoc and generally make your code easy to understand.
```python
#Docstring Example:
"""
This module_a does thing_a
"""
```
- Import Statements:
```python
#Necessary to guarantee the path contains all modules
import wheelsofjeopardy.[YOUR_PATH]
```
